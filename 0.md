# 3.1.1 Final (** denotes also requirement for Integrated MVP)
- Bugs
- ** Use iPXE target to avoid boot-storm when all servers try to boot from the SRN at the same time

---

# 4.0 MVP (** denotes also requirement for Integrated MVP)
- ** Smarter check-points that allow protection of database (and application) servers
- ** Fix rsync-based Linux replication
- ** Network isolation for fail-back
  - This is currently a manual action by the customer; if we are always CLC for DR, we can do this, but if not, we could potentially host a "temp" gateway for the DR side (or some other TBD solution)
- Storage check & repair for ROW-COW (depends on boot from local disk)
  - Currently no check and repair at all for ROW-COW, unlike COW-COW
  - QUESTION: Does local boot solve all scenarios, e.g. protecting physical servers?
  - This is important because, with local cache, there is (at least currently) a higher chance for inconsistency, making it important to check and repair
- ** [ENG] convert Syntropy to C++
- ** Client GUI enhancements
  - Start and stop replication for any number of guests (and throttle too)
  - Reporting more about the state and properties of the guest, including:
    - Replication status
    - iSCSI target connected or not
    - Dirty sectors after writes to iSCSI target, creating inconsistency between source server and PR-side SRN
- ** Automatic copy from target to source disk on fail-back

# Integrated DR MVP
- Web-based UI
  - Enable/set up DR
    - QUESTION: For CLC, is this by server group? Or is the PG separate from the server group?
  - (Depending on group questions above) Manage protection group:
    - Create a PG (inc. ROW-COW vs COW-COW)
    - Delete a PG
    - Add server to a PG
    - Remove server from a PG
    - Change sync throttle
    - Expand check-point pool (i.e., the size of pool)
    - Expand the cache size for ROW-COW
  - Test fail-over
  - Delete test fail-over
  - Real fail-over
  - Fail-back
  - Show status
  - Checkpoint management
    - Create
    - Edit Period
    - Roll back
  - Migrate
  - Replication
  - Check and repair
  - Progress and jobs
  - Fault states (like missing iSCSI target)
  - Show peers and network during failover and test failover and migration
- APIs
  - Anything we can do in the UI, we can do through an HTTP API
- Automatic updates, including to client software, that require no customer action
  - EASY: Web UI, API, CMS, SRN,
  - HARD: SBD, LRA
- Completely self-service (depends on automated installation)
  - Need no help to on-board/set up
  - Need no help add and remove servers from a protection group
  - No manual action after adding additional disks to source server
  - Basically all the UI that's part of MVP
- [ENG] Automated installation of all infrastructure
  - Create the CMS (if we have it
  - Create SRN
  - Create stubs
- [ENG] JIT provisioning of infrastructure
- [ENG] Every source server gets its own SRN
- Supports CLC/Primary <-> CLC/DR protection
  - QUESTION: Can we always put DR on CLC?

---

# Future
- Supports VMWare/Primary <-> CLC/DR protection
- Boot from local disk (instead of only iSCSI target)
- Support non-VMWare VMs (depends on boot from local disk)
- ** Faster fail-back for ROW-COW (depends on boot from local disk)
  - Currently, on fail-back, we copy the entire disk from P to DR; this would entail getting the source server on P side back to checkpoint and then only copying over the delta (since failover) from DR
  - Block-level replication for Linux
    - QUESTION: Is it important to support have ROW-COW for Linux
- Supports AWS/Primary <-> CLC/DR protection
- Supports Physical servers/Primary <-> CLC/DR protection
- Supports OpenStack/Primary <-> CLC/DR protection
- Supports vCloud/Primary <-> CLC/DR protection
