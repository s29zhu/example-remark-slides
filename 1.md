# SafeHaven 4.0 MVP 
+ Application-aware checkpoints so that we could protect following servers:.red[*]
  - Database server
  - Sharepoint server
  - Exchange server
  - Active Directory server (if self-assigned IP is supported in DR)
+ Automatic network isolation for test failover and failover.red[*]
  - Prevent the disrruption on PR when stand-by servers running with same
  	hostnames but different IPs during test-failover and failover
  - Current workaround is not sustainable and does not solve the entire problem
+ Client GUI enhancements.red[*]
  - Start/Stop/Pause replication on guest VMs
  - Change the replication speed
  - Report more about the state and properties of the guest, including:
      * Local replication status
      * Dirty data
      * iSCSI connection
      * Disk mappings
      * Replication rate  
  - *Connect guest to iSCSI target*
  - *Add disk mappings*
+ Automatic copy from iSCSI target to local disk during failback.red[*]
+ Storage check-and-repair for Local Cache PG
  - Quickly fix the DR broken image
+ Complete rsync-based Linux replication.red[*]
