#Goals of Integration
+ A self-activating product 
  - The DRaaS solution will be deployed with a few interactions
  - Does not need on-boarding team
+ Continuous delivery
+ A comprehensive  DRaaS solution
  - Protect servers with special applications such as database
  - A more sophicated test-failover
  - A profound way to solve the issue when sth goes wrong

#Integrate DR MVP
+ Only supports CLC/PR to CLC/DR:
  - Stand-alone SafeHaven supports all VMware based sites
  - 90% of current customers DRaaS are vCenter to CLC
+ Web-based UI 
  - Enable DRaaS 
  - Every operation that SH  can do
+ Backend enhancements to achieve completely self-service
  - Automatic DRaaS environment set up
  - Automatically matches the stub NIC to source VM NIC
  - Flexibility to add a VM to DRaaS or remove a VM from DRaaS
  - Flexibility to expand disk or add disk
  - Smart copy from iSCSI target to local disk during failback

+ Application-aware checkpoints so that we could protect following servers:
  - Database server 
  - Sharepoint server
  - Exchange server
  - Active Directory server (if self-assigned IP is supported in DR)
+ Automatic network isolation for test failover
  - Prevent the disrruption on PR when stand-by servers running with same
  	hostnames but different IPs
  - Current workaround is not sustainable and does not solve the
  entire problem
+ Storage check-and-repair for Local Cache PG
  - Quickly fix the DR broken image
  - Local replica PG has this feature
